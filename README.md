Copyright ¬© 2024 KIYOSE imuzu under GPL v2.

tomatoshell-js is a simple pomodoro timer program for Unix-like systems and Windows. It is written in JavaScript and can be run in Node.js or Bun runtime environments. I rewrote the [tomatoshell](https://github.com/LytixDev/tomatoshell) from shell script to Javascript for learning purposes.

## Installation

You need to have Node.js or Bun installed on your system to run tomatoshell-js.

Clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tomatoshell-js.git
$ cd tomatoshell-js
```

## Usage

Run the program:

```bash
$ node tomatoShell-js
```

Or if you are using Bun:

```bash
$ bun tomatoShell.js
```

That's it. Enjoy your productive time with tomatoshell-js üçÖ!
